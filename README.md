# Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) Subphenotype Analysis

## Project Overview

Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) is a critical healthcare challenge in intensive care units (ICUs), contributing to increased mortality and prolonged hospital stays. This project aims to identify distinct subphenotypes of VAP patients using Latent Class Analysis (LCA), K-Means Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). By leveraging biomarker profiles and clinical data, we analyze associations between subphenotypes and key patient outcomes such as hospital mortality, ventilator-free days (VFDs), and severity of illness.

## Objectives
- Identify VAP Subphenotypes using unsupervised clustering techniques (LCA, K-Means, GMM).
- Evaluate Clinical Outcomes across subphenotypes, including mortality, VFDs, and disease severity.
- - Feature Selection Using LASSO Regression to determine which biomarkers contribute most to patient differentiation.
Perform Statistical Tests to assess differences in demographic and clinical variables across subphenotypes.
- Estimate Relative Risk (RR) and Odds Ratios (OR) using Modified Poisson Regression and Logistic Regression to quantify associations with clinical outcomes.
